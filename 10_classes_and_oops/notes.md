- b.)Object.setPrototypeof(childObject , parentObject)
- c.)use spread(...) operator


# Make your own custom property/function on Objects  , Array , String , function
- It brings additional power to the dataTypes.
- desriedDataType.prototype.desiredProperty = function(){}/any other thing you want to make at your own.
